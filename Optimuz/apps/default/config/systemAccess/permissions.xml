This file defines the permissions used in the system for access management.

The basic structure is as the following:

<permissions>
	<permission id="integer" name="string" />
	...
</permissions>

All permissions are defined by the "permission" element, which must be placed 
inside the "permissions" element. The permission element has the following 
attributes:

- id: the unique identifier of the permission. Like a primary key of a table in 
a database.

- name: the name on which the permission can be identified in the system. This 
name is used to grant access permissions in the map.xml file.

Following is an example of some permissions settings:

<permissions>
	<permission id="1" name="manage-accounts" />
	<permission id="2" name="can-post" />
	<permission id="3" name="do-restricted-action" />
</permissions>
-->
<permissions>
</permissions>
