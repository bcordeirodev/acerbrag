This file defines the roles used in the system for access management.

The basic structure is as the following:

<roles>
	<role id="integer" name="string" label="string" isAdmin="boolean" />
	...
</roles>

All roles are defined by the "role" element, which must be placed inside the
"roles" element. The role element has the following attributes:

- id: the unique identifier of the role. Like a primary key of a table in a 
database.

- name: the name on which the role can be identified in the system. This name is
used to grant access permissions in the Map.xml file.

- label: the name displayed to the user. This is only an alias for the "name"
attribute.

- isAdmin: whether the role must be handled as an admin role. This setting can
be retrived by calling SystemAccessLogin::isAdmin(). Default is false.

Following is an example of some roles settings:

<roles>
	<role id="1" name="User" label="User" />
	<role id="2" name="SuperUser" label="Super user" />
	<role id="3" name="Admin" label="Administrator" isAdmin="true" />
</roles>
-->
<roles>
</roles>
