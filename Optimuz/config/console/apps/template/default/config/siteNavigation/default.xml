Configuration file of the application navigation.
Each link element is mapped to a controller. Below is a sample:

<link label="nickname" title="link title" url="URL part" mainMenu="boolean">
	<link label="nickname" title="link title" url="URL part" mainMenu="boolean">
	</link>
</link>

And now a sample of a (X)HTML link generated by the SiteNavigation class:

<a href="url" title="title">label</a>

Below is an explanation of all attributes:

- label: This is the text displayed in the link.

- title: The title of a link.

- url: This is the URL version of a class name or method name of the mapped
controller. So if you are mapping the call PageController::SomeMethod(), the url
attribute should be just "page" (for the controller) or "some-method" (for the
method). Any URL that does not match to an existing controller/method will be
ignored by the SiteNavigation class, but still can be used by the MenuController
if the mainMenu attribute is set to true.

- mainMenu: This attribute specifies whether the link should be displayed in the
main menu of the application. This menu is built using the MenuComponent. This
attribute accept the values true or false (default).
