This file defines a mapping for access management of controllers and methods.

The basic structure is as the following:

<map hasAccessByDefault="boolean" validationType="default|match">
	<controller name="string" role="string">
		<method name="string" role="string" />
	</controller>
	...
</map>

The root element is the "map", which has two attributes:

- hasAccessByDefault: is a boolean and defines whether requests to controllers
not listed in this file should be allowed. For example: if a user try to access
the URI /home/index (controller "HomeController", method "index") and there is
no definition for it in this file, the attribute hasAccessByDefault will be
used. If it is true, the request is allowed, otherwise the request is denied.
Methods inherits roles from controllers, so if a controller has the role "Admin"
for example, all methods not defined will have the same role.

- validationType: can have one of two values: default or match. If the value is
"default", users with higher roles will be able to access lower roles. This
means that a user with the role "Admin" will also be able to can access
controllers defined for users with role "User". In the other way if the value
is "match", a user will only have access to controllers defined for his role.
So an user with role "Admin" will only access controllers defined for the role
"Admin". The default value is "default".

The map element has as child the element "controller". And the element
controller has as child the element "method". Both controller and method have
the same attributes. They are:

- name: the name of the controller. For example, for the controller
HomeController the attribute name should be "Home".

- role: one of the roles defined in the Roles.xml file. Note that the name of
the role is case sensitive, so "User" is different from "user". There is a
special role that can be used to say that the controller/method can be accessed
by anonymous users, the "Anonymous" role. Using this role any user can access
the controller/method, even if he is not authenticated.

The controller element can have zero or more method elements.

Following is an example of a mapping:

<map hasAccessByDefault="true">
	<controller name="Home" role="Anonymous"></controller>
	<controller name="Client" role="SuperUser">
		<method name="list" role="User" />
	</controller>
	<controller name="System" role="Admin"></controller>
</map>

Note that roles of methods overwrites roles of controllers. So you can set a
default access for all methods of a controller, and change only some few that
need special rights.
