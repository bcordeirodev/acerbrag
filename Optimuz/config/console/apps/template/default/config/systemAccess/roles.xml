This file defines the roles used in the system for access management.

The basic structure is as the following:

<roles>
	<role id="integer" name="string" label="string" />
	...
</roles>

All roles are defined by the "role" element, which must be placed inside the
"roles" element. The role element has only three attributes:

- id: the unique identifier of the role. Like a primary key of a table in a 
database.

- name: the name on which the role can be identified in the system. This name is
used to grant access permissions in the Map.xml file.

- label: the name displayed to the user. This is only an alias for the "name"
attribute.

Following is an example of some roles settings:

<roles>
	<role id="1" name="User" label="User" />
	<role id="2" name="SuperUser" label="Super user" />
	<role id="3" name="Admin" label="Administrator" />
</roles>

You also can use strings from language files, using the syntax ${string_name}
like:

<role id="2" name="SuperUser" label="${role.superUser}" />

In the above example, the string role.superUser will be loaded from the language
file SystemAccess.lang. So if you use language files, you also need to add the
new roles to it.
